# CLIMB-TRE

## Introduction

The CLIMB Trusted Research Environment (CLIMB-TRE) project provides tools with which users can upload sequencing data, with metadata, and analyse them on [CLIMB](https://www.climb.ac.uk/).

This site documents how to use the CLIMB-TRE tools and is distinct from more general [documentation on using CLIMB](https://docs.climb.ac.uk/). Read further for general information on how to [upload](upload.md) or [analyse](analyse.md) data.
