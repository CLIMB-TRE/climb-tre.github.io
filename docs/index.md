# CLIMB-TRE

The CLIMB Trusted Research Environment (CLIMB-TRE) project provides tools
with which users can upload metagenomics data, with metadata, and analyse
them on [CLIMB](https://www.climb.ac.uk/).

This site documents how to use the CLIMB-TRE tools
and is distinct from more general
[documentation on using CLIMB](https://docs.climb.ac.uk/).
Read further for general information on how to [upload](upload.md)
or [analyse](analyse.md) data.
