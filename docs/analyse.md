# Analysing data

## Overview

Once data and metadata has been ingested into the Onyx database, you
can query it using the Onyx command line client.  The key commands
for getting started are documented here.
More documentation is provided in the
[`onyx-client` repo](https://github.com/CLIMB-TRE/onyx-client).
In short, you need to create a config (`onyx config create ...`) and
register (`onyx register`), after which you can query the database
of published data with other commands (list them with `onyx -h`).
